            <p>
                Dr. A. D. (Andy) Gunawardena has served as a Computer Science professor in multiple capacities in number of academic institutions including Carnegie Mellon University. <br>
  Princeton University and Rutgers University. He joined as a faculty member in the department of Computer Science at Princeton University in 2013. He also served as an Associate Teaching Professor of Computer Science <br>
  at Carnegie Mellon University from 1998-2013 and is now a courtesy faculty at CMU. He is a long time advocate of AI and technology in education and the application of the principles of learning sciences to learning. <br>
  He is the co-author of three college textbooks in computational linear algebra published by Springer-Verlag and Thompson Brooks-Cole and is the author and co-author of over 50 research articles. His textbooks have been <br>
  translated into other languages. He co-founded TextCentric, Inc in 2003, the first technologies to streamline publishing process using a proprietary technology called Adaptive Content Management System. <br>
  The technology was sold to Pearson publishing in 2008 and played a founding role in bringing Pearson technology operations to Sri Lanka. He is also the co-founder of Classroom Salon, a platform to increase student <br>
  engagement through annotations and analytics. Classroom Salon was acquired by Global TII in 2022. He has received over US$ 3 million in funding from NSF, Qatar Foundation, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Google and many <br>
  other foundations. His many honors include: leadership in technology award from HP, service award from Jesse Jones institute, ACM appreciation award from ACM Houston chapter, and <br>
  Exceptional achievement award (highest honor given to Sri Lankan expatriate) from Sri Lanka foundation. He was also a founding fellow of HP Catalyst Institute in 2010. From 2010-2013, he co-led the HP's measuring learning <br>
  consortium, a multi-million dollar effort to introduce data driven learning. He is the principle inventor of US Patent 10,061,756 sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University and is the principle inventor of Princeton University <br>
  based patents machine assisted segmentation of video collections(US Patents # 10810436 #11126858 ). He is a co-founder of CUbits.ai a Princeton University based startup aiming to provide indexing and search capabilities <br>
  for large video collections. The company was founded with multiple innovation grants from Princeton innovation fund. He is also the lead for CodeBench (http://codebench.us) a platform designed to scale AI and <br>
  Data Science Education. He received Grossman Innovation award in 2024. He is currently the stream editor for learning analytics at the International Journal of innovation in online education. <br>
  He typically teaches courses in data science, computer algorithms, discrete structures, systems programming, and pen-based computing. His research interests include in AI in education/training and <br>
  Human Computer Interaction for building human-centric intefaces.
